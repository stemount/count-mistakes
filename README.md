# count-mistakes
Count the amount of times an exception is thrown when you refresh a web project.

## Potential Implementation/Functionality 

1. Regex Parse console output from the browser or through CLI.
2. Give a report (could be through a chrome extension, command-line tool, electron app, etc) about the exception. The report could articulate more than the times thrown, for example, it could show potentially related exceptions or causality of them (for example).
